**Integrating Multi-Omics Datasets to Build Regulatory Networks and Identify Molecular Drivers of Micronutrient Deficiency in Pregnancy**

## Overview

This repository contains the complete codebase and analytical pipeline for an MSc research project focused on integrating multi-omics data with clinical features to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying vitamin B12 deficiency during pregnancy. 

The project employs advanced statistical modeling, biological network reconstruction, and machine learning approaches to:

- Identify regulatory relationships across DNA methylation (CpG), mRNA, and miRNA molecular layers
- Develop interpretable multi-omics predictive models for micronutrient deficiency
- Discover consistent molecular drivers and biological pathways associated with B12 status

## Key Features

- üìä **Multi-omics Integration**: Combines DNA methylation (RRBS), mRNA expression (RNA-seq), and miRNA expression (small RNA-seq) datasets
- üß¨ **Regulatory Network Modeling**: Infers CpG‚ÄìmRNA and miRNA‚ÄìmRNA regulatory interactions using biologically-informed statistical approaches  
- ü§ñ **Machine Learning Pipeline**: Implements Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks with both data-driven and mechanism-driven feature selection strategies
- üß† **Model Interpretability**: Comprehensive feature importance analysis, cross-model consensus evaluation, and biological relevance assessment
- üìà **Functional Analysis**: GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of key genes identified across omics layers

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- R 4.0 or higher (for certain statistical analyses)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WeilinHe00619/P056_Integrating_Msc.git
   cd P056_Integrating_Msc
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**
   ```bash
   # Using conda (recommended)
   conda create -n multiomics_env python=3.9
   conda activate multiomics_env
   
   # Or using venv
   python -m venv multiomics_env
   source multiomics_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: multiomics_env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Verify installation**
   ```bash
   python scripts/4_modeling/run_model_rf.py --test
   ```

> **Note**: You may need to adjust data file paths in the configuration files based on your local directory structure.


### Individual Analysis Modules
Each analysis step can be run independently. See the `scripts/` directory for detailed usage instructions for each module.

## Main Findings

- **Predictive Performance**: Achieved robust classification of B12 deficiency status with interpretable multi-omics models
- **Key Molecular Features**: Identified consistent biomarkers across models including clinical features (BMI, Age) and molecular markers (CCNG1, IQCG)
- **Biological Insights**: Revealed enriched pathways related to metabolic regulation, immune response, and developmental processes
- **Methodological Innovation**: Demonstrated the effectiveness of both statistical and regulation-driven feature selection strategies
